Our compiler does not allow the declaration of a variable with type void but it does allow the declaration of variables with type top.
For instance the following code will not compile: 'void x = 4;' 

You cannot create an alias for void or any other key words eg if

Multiple declaration are allowed on 1 line. For example:
int a = 3, b = 4;

The compiler will allow statements like:
seq<int> test = 4;
Because we do not check any of the semantics

You can only access an index or key of an idenfifier. For instance:
testing[1].
While [1, 2, 3][0], ([0] :: [1])[0] and functionCall()[0] are not allowed.

You can copy an entire array by using this sequence slicing syntax:
seq<int> a = [1, 2, 3]
seq<int> b = a[:]

Blocks of code like a main function, loops and if statements must have at
least 1 statement and can have 0 or more declarations.

The syntax of print and read can be with and without brackets. For instance:
read x;
read(x);

We assume that main does not require a return statement.

Aliasing and declaring a new type is allowed anywhere, even inside of a function.

Declarations always come before staements in function bodies.

We assumed the '_' was an important part of  the numerator of rational numbers.
We assumed stings could have escaped special characters inside of them.

string is not a keyword.
