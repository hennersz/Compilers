Our compiler does not allow the declaration of a variable with type void or top.
For instance the following code will not compile: 'top x = 4;' 
We only allow top within a dictionary or a sequence as in:
seq<top> a = ['a', 1]

You cannot create an alias for top or void

Multiple declaration are allowed on 1 line. For example:
int a = 3, b = 4;

The compiler will allow statements like:
seq<int> test = 4;
Because we do not check any of the semantics

You can only access an index or key of an idenfifier. For instance:
testing[1].
While [1, 2, 3][0], ([0] :: [1])[0] and functionCall()[0] are not allowed.

You can copy an entire array by using this sequence slicing syntax:
seq<int> a = [1, 2, 3]
seq<int> b = a[:]

Blocks of code like a main function, loops and if statements cannot be empty.

The syntax of print and read can be with and without brackets. For instance:
read x;
read(x);

We assume that main does not require a return statement.

Aliasing and declaring a new type is allowed anywhere, even inside of a function.
