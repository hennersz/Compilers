Public test sources for Part I of the Compilers Project

The p-* files are postive tests cases, ones your parser should parse correctly,
printing "parsing successful" on a single line;  the n-* files are negative
tests cases, ones on which your parser should fail, correctly specifying the
line and the column within that line in which the syntax error occurs.
